# Interactive Navigation Menu

This is a simple web project that features a *fixed navigation menu* that stays at the top of the page and changes its style when the user scrolls or hovers over the menu items. I built this using *HTML, **CSS, and **JavaScript* to practice frontend interactivity and layout techniques.

---

## 🌟 What I Built

- A *fixed navbar* that remains visible even when scrolling.
- When you *hover* over a menu item, it highlights with a smooth effect.
- When you *scroll down*, the navbar changes its background to make it more noticeable.
- It’s designed to be included on *multiple pages*, like Home, About, Projects, and Contact.

## 🧰 Tech Used

- *HTML* – for the basic structure of the page and menu  
- *CSS* – for styling, hover effects, and scroll animations  
- *JavaScript* – to detect scrolling and apply interactive behavior

## 📁 Files Included

- index.html – Main page with the nav menu  
- style.css – Styling for the whole layout including navbar  
- script.js – Script that adds the scroll and hover effects  
- Optional additional pages like about.html, projects.html, etc.

## 💡 Why I Made This

I wanted to create a real-world component that’s used in almost every modern website. Fixed and interactive navigation menus help users stay oriented and make the site feel more polished. This also gave me a chance to practice working with DOM events and styling transitions.
